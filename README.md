# Frequency Counter
This code is a simple program for calculating the frequency of letters in a text file. The program opens the file, reads the contents into a buffer, and then creates child processes to calculate the frequency of each letter in the alphabet. The frequency is calculated by dividing the number of times a given letter appears in the text by the total number of alphabetical characters in the text. The result is printed to the console as a percentage. The program is written in C++ and makes use of several standard C++ libraries, including iostream, fstream, and string.
